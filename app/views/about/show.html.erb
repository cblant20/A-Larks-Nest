		A Lark's Nest provides event, portraiture, and pet photography services. We will make your experience magical! We love working with all ages, races, genders, and orientations.
	</p><p>
		Our home base is Atlanta, GA but we travel across the US and around the world to bring our unique vision to you. Catch us strolling the picturesque canals of Strasbourg, France or hiking the breath-taking forests of Eugene, OR. We'll take your perfect engagement photos on a chateau over-looking the wine valleys of Germany.
	</p><p>
		Our passion is capturing your most important memories and telling your story through our art. We focus on the little details in spaces and the emotional moments between people. At events, we capture hugs, children lighting up with wonder, and friends laughing together.
